- Quote and quote request handling
- Integration with Avro schemas for data serialization
- RESTful API endpoints
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment support
- Monitoring with Prometheus and logging with Loki/Promtail

## Project Structure
- `src/main/` - Main application source code
- `src/test/` - Test sources
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Containerization setup
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration
- `k8s/` - Kubernetes deployment manifests
- `prometheus.yml`, `loki-config.yml`, `promtail-config.yml` - Monitoring and logging configs
- `generated-avro/` - Avro schema definitions

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Gradle
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Kubernetes (optional, for deployment)
