# OMS Development Team Manifesto: Core Values & Principles

**Preamble:**

We, the OMS development team, are committed to building a high-quality, robust and scalable Order Management System that meets the needs of our users and stakeholders. We believe in a culture of continuous improvement, open communication, and data-driven decision-making. This manifesto outlines our core values and principles, guiding our work and fostering a collaborative and productive environment. We strive for truthfulness, transparency and a shared commitment to excellence.

**I. Core Values:**

1.  **Truthfulness and Transparency:**
    *   **Principle:** We believe in stating our honest opinions and perspectives, even when they are difficult or unpopular.
    *   **Application:** We will openly discuss challenges, risks, and failures. We will provide constructive feedback directly and respectfully. We will share information openly and proactively, avoiding hidden agendas.
    *   **Why:** To foster trust, identify problems early, and make better decisions.

2.  **Ownership and Accountability:**
    *   **Principle:** Everyone on the team takes ownership of their work and is accountable for its quality and impact.
    *   **Application:** We will take responsibility for our actions and decisions. We will proactively identify and address issues. We will deliver on our commitments and hold ourselves to a high standard of performance.
    *   **Why:** To ensure that work is done well, problems are solved effectively, and the team achieves its goals.

3.  **Continuous Learning and Improvement:**
    *   **Principle:** We are committed to continuous learning and improvement, both individually and as a team.
    *   **Application:** We will actively seek out new knowledge and skills. We will experiment with new technologies and techniques. We will regularly reflect on our performance and identify areas for improvement. We will embrace feedback and use it to grow.
    *   **Why:** To stay ahead of the curve, improve our skills and build a better product.

4.  **Collaboration and Teamwork:**
    *   **Principle:** We believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. We work together to achieve shared goals.
    *   **Application:** We will actively listen to and respect the perspectives of others. We will share our knowledge and expertise. We will support and help each other. We will celebrate our successes together.
    *   **Why:** To leverage the diverse skills and perspectives of the team and achieve more than we could individually.

5.  **Simplicity and Clarity:**
    *   **Principle:** We strive for simplicity and clarity in everything we do.
    *   **Application:** We will design systems that are easy to understand and maintain. We will write code that is clear, concise, and well-documented. We will communicate effectively and avoid jargon.
    *   **Why:** To reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and make it easier for everyone to contribute.

6.  **Data-Driven Decision-Making:**
    *   **Principle:** We base our decisions on data and evidence, not on opinions or assumptions.
    *   **Application:** We will collect and analyze data to understand the performance of our systems. We will use data to inform our design decisions. We will track key metrics to measure our progress.
    *   **Why:** To make informed decisions, avoid biases, and improve our results.

**II. Development Principles:**

1.  **Specification-Driven Development:**
    *   **Principle:** Development is driven by clear and comprehensive specifications (e.g., OpenAPI, Avro schemas, user stories with acceptance criteria).
    *   **Application:** We will prioritize well-defined specifications before writing code. We will use specifications to generate code, tests, and documentation. We will ensure that all code adheres to the specifications.
    *   **Why:** To ensure that we are building the right thing, reduce ambiguity, and improve code quality.

2.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
    *   **Principle:** We write tests before writing code to ensure that our code is testable and meets the requirements.
    *   **Application:** We will write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. We will use BDD frameworks to define acceptance criteria in a clear and understandable way.
    *   **Why:** To improve code quality, reduce bugs, and ensure that our code meets the requirements.

3.  **Event Sourcing and CQRS:**
    *   **Principle:** We embrace Event Sourcing for persistence and CQRS for separating read and write operations.
    *   **Application:** We will model state changes as events and store them in an event log. We will use CQRS to optimize read and write performance.
    *   **Why:** To enable auditability, replayability, and scalability.

4.  **Microservices Architecture:**
    *   **Principle:** We design our system as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled microservices.
    *   **Application:** We will break down complex functionality into smaller, manageable services. We will use APIs to communicate between services. We will deploy and scale services independently.
    *   **Why:** To improve scalability, resilience, and agility.

5.  **Automation:**
    *   **Principle:** We automate everything we can to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.
    *   **Application:** We will automate builds, tests, deployments, and monitoring. We will use infrastructure as code to manage our infrastructure. We will leverage generative AI tools to automate repetitive tasks.
    *   **Why:** To reduce errors, improve speed, and free up time for more creative and strategic work.

6.  **Embrace Generative AI:**
    *   **Principle:**  We will explore and strategically apply generative AI tools to enhance our development process.
    *   **Application:** We will use AI for code generation, test case generation, documentation, code analysis, and other relevant tasks. We will critically evaluate the output of AI tools and ensure that it meets our quality standards.
    *   **Why:** To accelerate development, improve code quality, and free up time for more complex problem-solving.

**III. Decision-Making Process:**

1.  **Open Discussion:** Major decisions will be made through open discussion and debate. All team members are encouraged to share their opinions and perspectives.
2.  **Data-Driven Analysis:** We will strive to base our decisions on data and evidence whenever possible.
3.  **Consensus-Oriented:** We will aim for consensus, but when consensus cannot be reached, the team lead will make the final decision, taking into account all perspectives.
4.  **Documented Rationale:** The rationale behind all major decisions will be documented and shared with the team.

**IV. Review and Adaptation:**

This manifesto is a living document and will be reviewed and adapted regularly to ensure that it continues to reflect our values and principles. We encourage all team members to contribute to this process.

**Conclusion:**

By embracing these core values and principles, we are confident that we can build a successful and impactful Order Management System that delivers value to our users and stakeholders. We commit to upholding these principles in our daily work and to fostering a culture of excellence within the OMS development team.
