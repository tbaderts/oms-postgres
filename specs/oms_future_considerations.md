# OMS Future Considerations and Technology Direction

**I. Core Concepts and Technologies**

Before diving into specific use cases, let's establish some key concepts:

*   **Agentic AI:** Instead of just *using* AI models passively, agentic AI involves creating autonomous "agents" that can perceive their environment, make decisions, take actions, and learn over time. These agents can interact with the OMS, other systems, and even human users. Think of them as intelligent assistants that can automate tasks, solve problems, and provide insights.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** MCP is a critical enabler. It provides a standardized way for AI models (and agents) to access and understand the context they need to make informed decisions. For OMS, this context includes:
    *   Domain Object State: Current state of orders, executions, etc.
    *   Event History: The sequence of events that have affected a domain object.
    *   Business Rules: Validation rules, state transition rules, routing rules, etc.
    *   Market Data: Real-time market information.
    *   Execution Desk Preferences: Configuration and rules set by the execution desk.
*   **Key Technologies/Frameworks:**
    *   **LLMs (Large Language Models):** For natural language processing, understanding complex instructions, and generating human-readable explanations.
    *   **Vector Databases:** To store and efficiently retrieve embeddings of domain object states, events, and rules for semantic search and context retrieval.
    *   **Orchestration Frameworks:** Tools like Spring AI, Semantic Kernel, or custom-built orchestrators to manage the flow of information and actions between agents, models, and the OMS.
    *   **Decision Support Systems:** Augment the workflow of agentic AI to allow human in the loop decision making, oversight and validation

**II. Prioritized Use Cases and Exploration Areas**

Here are some use cases, ranked by potential impact and feasibility, along with specific suggestions:

1.  **AI-Powered End-to-End Test Automation and Regression (High Impact, Medium Complexity):**

    *   **Concept:** Create AI agents that can automatically generate test cases, execute tests, and analyze results.
    *   **How it Works:**
        *   **Test Case Generation:** The AI agent uses the OpenAPI and Avro schemas to understand the API contracts. It accesses domain object states (using the Query API) to generate realistic test data. It can also analyze past test failures to generate tests that specifically target known weaknesses.
        *   **Test Execution:** The agent uses the Command API to execute test scenarios and observes the resulting events.
        *   **Result Analysis:** The agent analyzes the events to determine if the tests passed or failed. It can use LLMs to generate human-readable explanations of test failures.
        *   **Regression Testing:**  The AI agent can automatically re-run tests whenever the code changes to ensure that new code doesn't break existing functionality.
    *   **Worth Exploring:**
        *   Using LLMs to generate test cases from natural language descriptions of requirements.
        *   Generating synthetic data to simulate trading scenarios and augment traditional testing

2.  **AI-Powered Operations and Problem Analysis (High Impact, Medium Complexity):**

    *   **Concept:** Use AI agents to monitor the OMS, detect anomalies, and diagnose problems.
    *   **How it Works:**
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** The AI agent monitors key metrics (e.g., order processing latency, execution rates, error rates) and uses machine learning models to detect unusual patterns.
        *   **Root Cause Analysis:** When an anomaly is detected, the AI agent uses MCP to access event logs, domain object states, and system logs to identify the root cause of the problem. It can use LLMs to generate hypotheses about the cause of the problem and test those hypotheses by querying the OMS.
        *   **Automated Remediation:** In some cases, the AI agent can automatically remediate problems (e.g., restarting a failed service, scaling up resources).
    *   **Worth Exploring:**
        *   Integrating with existing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
        *   Using LLMs to generate alerts and notifications that are tailored to the specific problem.
        *   Creating a "chatbot" interface that allows operations engineers to interact with the AI agent and ask questions about the system.

3.  **Intelligent Execution Desk Assistance (Medium Impact, High Complexity):**

    *   **Concept:** Provide AI agents that can assist the execution desk with their daily tasks.
    *   **How it Works:**
        *   **Order Routing Optimization:** The AI agent can analyze market data, order characteristics, and execution desk preferences to recommend the optimal routing strategy for orders.
        *   **Exception Handling:** The AI agent can identify and prioritize orders that require manual intervention (e.g., orders that have failed validation, orders that are stuck in a particular state).
        *   **Market Anomaly Detection:** The AI agent can analyze market data in real-time and alert the execution desk to potential anomalies (e.g., flash crashes, unexpected price movements).
    *   **Worth Exploring:**
        *   Integrating with the Execution Desk UI to provide real-time recommendations and alerts.
 

4.  **AI-Powered Compliance and Auditability (Medium Impact, Medium Complexity):**

    *   **Concept:** Automate compliance checks and improve auditability using AI.
    *   **How it Works:**
        *   **Rule Enforcement Monitoring:** AI agents monitor order and execution data to ensure compliance with regulatory rules and internal policies. MCP provides the agents with the relevant rule definitions.
        *   **Audit Trail Analysis:** LLMs can analyze event logs to generate human-readable audit trails, explaining the sequence of events leading to a particular outcome.
    *   **Worth Exploring:**
        *   Integrating with regulatory reporting systems.

**III. Implementation Considerations**

*   **Explainability and Transparency:** AI agents' decisions need to be transparent and explainable, especially with regards to regulations.
*   **Model Context Protocol Implementation:** Design a robust and efficient mechanism for providing AI agents with access to the information they need. This might involve:
    *   A knowledge graph that represents the relationships between different entities in the OMS.
    *   Embedding domain object states and events in a vector database for semantic search.
